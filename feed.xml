It is easier than ever to find and book a Hilton Hotel using points.
However, the points explorer is not always the right tool to use.
Here we guide you through the hassle-free way to book a Hilton Hotel with points, based on the criteria you have for your upcoming trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#flexible-dates&quot;&gt;Book with Flexible Dates/Destination&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: This is where the Points Explorer shines, but only if you know how to navigate the results.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#strict-dates&quot;&gt;Book a Known Destination with Strict Dates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: This is where the Points Explorer struggles, but a small twist on the normal booking process makes it straightfoward.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#evaluating-the-award-booking&quot;&gt;Evaluating the Award Booking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Hilton’s &lt;em&gt;Points &amp;amp; Money slider&lt;/em&gt; makes it easy to evaluate your award booking once you’ve selected a room.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;flexible-datesdestination&quot;&gt;Flexible Dates/Destination&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Points Explorer is an ideal place to go only under the following conditions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The dates are flexible.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You have a rough idea of which hotels/brands you might be interested in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is because Points Explorer does not have a “date” filter and forces you to select a hotel using only its name, location and mininum/maximum points per night. If you need to explore some hotels first, it is best to go explore somewhere else and come back with some hotel names and/or brands in mind&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.  When you are ready, let Points Explorer find you the best award options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://pointsexplorer.hiltonhonors.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hilton Points Explorer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set your points per night limit and click &lt;strong&gt;Search&lt;/strong&gt; (yes, leave the “Where do you want to go” input blank, we’ll update that next!)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On the new page, you can dynamically change the “Location” input to filter results. Location can be a Hotel Name, Brand, and/or City/State/Country. There is a lot of flexibility here.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Find a hotel that interests you, and take note of the points range.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click on &lt;strong&gt;Check Availability&lt;/strong&gt; to open a new page to book for that hotel.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You will notice that the default dates are set to today, and the points per night may be very different than the ones advertised. This is where date flexibility is important.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On &lt;strong&gt;Edit stay&lt;/strong&gt;, click on one of the dates, and select &lt;strong&gt;Shop by Price&lt;/strong&gt; at the bottom of the popup.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Now you can see the points per night for all dates in a month. Navigate around to find a range of dates with the point values you noted earlier. Use this to define the start and end date of your vacation!
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;If you don’t like any of the date options, just close the window. The Points Explorer is waiting right where you left it on step 4.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Select the first date of your vacation to go back to the &lt;strong&gt;Select a Room&lt;/strong&gt; page.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On &lt;strong&gt;Edit stay&lt;/strong&gt;, click on the second date (departure) and set it to the end date of your vacation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Select &lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt; to see the new rates for your stay.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Now it’s time to &lt;a href=&quot;#evaluating-the-award-booking&quot;&gt;evaluate and finalize the award booking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;strict-dates&quot;&gt;Strict Dates&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When travel dates are strict, Points Explorer is more of a distraction than benefit.  In these cases, it is better to use the “Special Rates” feature to find award rates via the normal booking process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Log in to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hilton.com/en/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hilton.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enter the destination and dates of your trip on the main page.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Minor Twist&lt;/strong&gt;: Click on &lt;em&gt;Special Rates&lt;/em&gt; and select &lt;em&gt;Use Points&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click &lt;em&gt;Find a Hotel&lt;/em&gt; to see the options.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The results will appear with the cost listed as points/night.  Find a hotel of interest and select &lt;strong&gt;View Rates&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Now it’s time to &lt;a href=&quot;#evaluating-the-award-booking&quot;&gt;evaluate and finalize the award booking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;evaluating-the-award-booking&quot;&gt;Evaluating the Award Booking&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you reach the reservation page of an award booking you can start evaluating whether this is a good point value for you&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.  The page shows the different room types for the selected hotel, each with points per night (e.g. 26,000 points/night) and approximate dollar value (e.g. Rates From $141).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Select the &lt;strong&gt;Book Now&lt;/strong&gt; box (the one with the present) on the room of interest to get to the final pricing information and reach Hilton’s other useful award booking tool: the &lt;em&gt;Points &amp;amp; Money slider&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the &lt;strong&gt;Payment and Guest Details&lt;/strong&gt; page, you can use the &lt;em&gt;Points &amp;amp; Money slider&lt;/em&gt; to determine if this booking is a good deal. Slide all the way to the right to see the total number of points for the booking (e.g. 104,000 points for a 5 night stay with 26,000 points/night – 5th night free!). Now slide all the way to the left to see the total number of dollars for the booking (e.g. $809.58 for a 5 night stay at $141/night + tax).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calculate the value of your points: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$809.58 / 104,000 * 100 = 0.78 cents/point&lt;/code&gt;. And the fifth night free makes this a great award booking&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;! Congratulations if you found a similar deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do not have enough points for the full stay, you can always adjust the slider and perform similar calculations to see if it is worth using partial points on the booking. For example, sliding to the middle might give you 52,000 Points + $424.32. Now subtract that cost from the cost of using no points ($809.58) and divide by the points: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;($809.58 - $492.14) / 52,000 * 100 = 0.61 cents/point&lt;/code&gt;.  Not as great as if you used only points, but still a solid use of points for most people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Hilton doesn’t have a great service for just exploring. Google is your friend here. To dream big, start with “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=best+hilton+honors+redemptions&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;Best Hilton Honors Redemptions&lt;/a&gt;” and see where it takes you. Then come back to book once you have some ideas in mind. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you have any &lt;a href=&quot;https://millionmilesecrets.com/guides/hilton-status/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hilton Elite Status&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, remember the 5th night is always free for Standard Room Rewards! But this discount is not represented in the points per night estimations until you reach the &lt;em&gt;Payment and Guest Details&lt;/em&gt; page of the booking process. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Most evaluations of Hilton points place them between 0.4 and 0.6 cents per point, so receiving 0.78 cents per point would be a great deal for almost everyone. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;

But as you start maximizing your rewards, you will find yourself creating many online accounts and periodically opening a credit card.  While you don’t need to fear security breaches, it is imperative that you know how to protect your accounts, your credit, and your finances from potential issues.  The following steps will reduce your exposure to threats and allow you to react quickly if any of your information is compromised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#strengthen-your-accounts&quot;&gt;Strengthen Your Accounts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: As you manage online accounts, use strong passwords and store them in a secure place (hint: a piece of paper rarely does the job&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#track-your-credit-score&quot;&gt;Monitor Your Credit Score&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Understand the factors that make up your credit score, and use a service to monitor it (hint: never pay to see your credit score).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#freeze-your-credit&quot;&gt;Freeze Your Credit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Restrict access to your credit report to control when new accounts can be opened (hint: it’s easier than it sounds).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#monitor-your-expenses&quot;&gt;Track Your Expenses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Set a budget and track your expenses to reduce the temptation to spend more (hint: credit card companies excel at enticing people to swipe more often).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#learn-more&quot;&gt;Learn More&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Subscribe to &lt;a href=&quot;https://anchor.fm/pointheads&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;our podcast&lt;/a&gt; to follow along step by step.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;strengthen-your-accounts&quot;&gt;Strengthen Your Accounts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you open accounts for all the reward programs in your life, that go-to password suddenly gets replicated all over the internet. Simple and duplicate passwords make your accounts vulnerable to a potential attack on an unrelated, less-secure website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure you create complex passwords and rotate usernames to keep each account secure and independent from others. When available, use &lt;a href=&quot;https://authy.com/what-is-2fa/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;two-factor authentication&lt;/a&gt; to limit where and how an account can be accessed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for help remembering (and even generating) so many unique passwords, we recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lastpass.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;LastPass&lt;/a&gt; as a much more secure alternative to storing them in your browser (seriously, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techrepublic.com/article/why-you-should-never-allow-your-web-browser-to-save-your-passwords/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;never store a password in your browser&lt;/a&gt;). LastPass (and other password managers) also have tools to alert you of potentially compromised accounts, so that you can update your credentials quickly&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;track-your-credit-score&quot;&gt;Track Your Credit Score&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you age, your credit score becomes the primary means for other companies to judge you.  With reward points so closely tied to financial accounts, you can protect yourself by keeping an eye on your credit score and understanding how different actions might alter it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the actual computation is proprietary and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/new-fico-score-10-t&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;occasionally modified&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.myfico.com/credit-education/whats-in-your-credit-score&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;major factors contributing to your credit score&lt;/a&gt; are fairly consistent:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Payment History&lt;/em&gt;: The simplest way to build a good score is to pay your bills each month. This is why “paying off your credit card” is always in the top three on the credit card version of the 10 commandments&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Credit Utilization&lt;/em&gt;: This is the balance on your credit card versus the maximum balance allowed. Paying off your balance in full (and even optimizing when you pay it off) will improve your score every time. Ironically, so does getting approved for a new credit card, assuming your monthly spending stays constant.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Length of Credit History&lt;/em&gt;: This is the age of all the accounts in your report.  Keeping a credit card longer helps your score in this respect. As long as you stay organized and keep the account secure, it is generally a good idea to keep those no annual fee cards open forever to help this part of your score.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Credit Mix&lt;/em&gt;: This one indicates whether you are organized enough to manage different types of debt. It is much less significant than the first three. You can generally ignore its impact, as it doesn’t make sense to take out loans you don’t need just to try to improve this part of your score. Let your lifestyle adjust it organically.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Credit&lt;/em&gt;: Opening new accounts will hurt this part of your score. While it has a minor impact on your overall score, most &lt;a href=&quot;https://upgradedpoints.com/applying-for-credit-cards-bank-rules&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;banks now have specific rules&lt;/a&gt; based on your recent account openings. You must be mindful of how many accounts you have opened to avoid looking desperate for credit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no need to ever pay to see your credit score. If you are looking for free help to monitor your score, alert you of changes and provide tips to keep your score healthy, we recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.creditkarma.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Credit Karma&lt;/a&gt;. By now most banks are also providing some similar free services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;freeze-your-credit&quot;&gt;Freeze Your Credit&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to open a new line of credit, the lender will typically require a full review (i.e. “hard pull”) of your credit report.  To protect yourself from potential identity theft, you can tell the three major credit bureaus not to provide those reports until you authorize it.  This is called a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/how-to-freeze-credit&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;credit freeze&lt;/a&gt; and is a mandatory free service provided by each credit bureau&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it does take some extra planning and a bit more time (you must temporarily lift the freeze before anyone can access your full credit report), it is generally recommended to keep a grasp on your accounts while you dive into points and miles.  The process to freeze and unfreeze is straightforward and can be done entirely online.  NerdWallet has an excellent guide for managing each one:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/transunion-credit-freeze&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;TransUnion&lt;/a&gt; gets our award for simplest to freeze and unfreeze.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/equifax-credit-freeze&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Equifax&lt;/a&gt; is pretty user-friendly with an online account, but they also make it easiest to accidentally sign up for a service you don’t want&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Make sure you follow the steps carefully and don’t give them your credit card information if you only want to freeze and unfreeze.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/experian-credit-freeze&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Experian&lt;/a&gt; is the least user-friendly, especially if you haven’t lived in the same place for more than 2 years.  Follow the guide and you will get through it. For bonus points and future sanity, save your pin number in &lt;a href=&quot;#strengthen-your-accounts&quot;&gt;LastPass, or your preferred secure password manager&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that credit monitoring services like Credit Karma still work while your report is frozen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;monitor-your-expenses&quot;&gt;Monitor Your Expenses&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While earning rewards is great when you use it to fulfill your goals, earning rewards via credit card purchases may pose a significant threat to your finances. Credit card companies excel at enticing people to spend more by offering lucrative earning opportunities.  Before you dive too deep, make sure you set up some checks and balances to keep you from spending beyond your budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish a Budget&lt;/strong&gt;:  Whether it’s daily or yearly, total amount or split by categories, find a system that works for you and define some numbers specifying how much you expect to be spending.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set Spending Alerts&lt;/strong&gt;: Every credit card company offers a set of alerts notifying you via email or text about various events. For each card you own, sign in and set up alerts that can help you stay on your budget and alert you if your credit card is being used in unexpected ways. Some of the most useful options are for purchases over an amount, balance exceeding an amount, and irregular uses such as cash advances or foreign transactions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Record your Expenses&lt;/strong&gt;: Whether it’s manual or automated, find a system that works for you to record what you spend.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review your Expenses&lt;/strong&gt;: Set aside time at regular periods to review your expenses and track against your budget. You can even use a service to send you reports/alerts regarding your overall spending habits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for a service to help budget and track expenses, we recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://mint.intuit.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mint&lt;/a&gt;. With Mint, you can set up alerts to immediately notify you of any irregular spending patterns to make sure your finances are always in order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Just ask the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/12/technology/bitcoin-passwords-wallets-fortunes.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;would-be BitCoin Millionaires&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For example, did you know about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cyber-attacks/2012-linkedin-breach-117-million-emails-and-passwords-stolen-not-6-5m&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;LinkedIn’s security breach in 2012&lt;/a&gt;? With an alert system in place, you would have modified your credentials long before the compromised data went up for sale 4 years later. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Everybody wants to turn responsible credit card use into the 10 commandments. Google &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;credit card 10 commandments&lt;/code&gt; and see how many versions there are! &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;A credit freeze is different from a “credit lock”. Credit freezes are mandatory to offer and must be free, while a credit lock is typically a paid service offering some unessential services in addition to the freeze. Make sure you choose the free freeze unless you understand the difference and really want the lock. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:4&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;I suppose Equifax needs to pay for that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/cases-proceedings/refunds/equifax-data-breach-settlement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;security breach settlement&lt;/a&gt; somehow. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:5&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The following steps will reduce your exposure to threats and allow you to react quickly if any of your information is compromised.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.pointheads.com/assets/images/posts/credit_security.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://www.pointheads.com/assets/images/posts/credit_security.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Choosing and Applying for Our First Business Card</title><link href="https://www.pointheads.com/posts/first_business_card/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Choosing and Applying for Our First Business Card" /><published>2021-01-15T20:33:50-06:00</published><updated>2021-01-15T20:33:50-06:00</updated><id>https://www.pointheads.com/posts/first_business_card</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.pointheads.com/posts/first_business_card/">&lt;p&gt;It was time to dive into the points and miles world, and we decided to go straight to the deep end.  With my wife Kristin’s growing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.northwestskills.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;basketball training business&lt;/a&gt;, it seemed to be the perfect time to apply for our first ever business credit card.  Having never gone through an application process before, we were loaded with questions and hesitations, but with a bit of planning we were ready to give it a shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#choosing-the-card&quot;&gt;Choosing the Card&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: With eyes on Hawaii, we identified the Chase Ink Business Preferred® Card as the best fit for Kristin’s business.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#planning-for-the-welcome-offer&quot;&gt;Planning for the Welcome Offer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: To ensure Northwest Skills could meet the hefty $5,000 minimum spend in three months, we needed to clarify exactly what is allowed to be charged on a business card.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#applying-for-credit&quot;&gt;Applying for Credit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Finally confident with the financial aspects, we followed an application guide to see if Chase considered Northwest Skills worthy of credit.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#did-it-work&quot;&gt;Did It Work?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Sort of (thanks, Covid).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;choosing-the-card&quot;&gt;Choosing the Card&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We finally took the time to understand the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fundera.com/blog/business-credit-card-requirements&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;benefits of having a business credit card&lt;/a&gt;.
It was just a matter of finding a card that aligned with the business and our travel goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Northwest Skill’s biggest business expense is gym rental space. Beyond that, it is all about transportation costs to games and practices, plus the occasional hotel room/meal for weekend tournaments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our travel goal was clear: after waiting for twelve years, it was Hawaii or bust.  The Points Guy provides a &lt;a href=&quot;https://thepointsguy.com/guide/points-and-miles-to-hawaii/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;complete guide&lt;/a&gt; on using travel rewards to get there. We were looking at ~140,000 Singapore KrisFlyer Miles to get our family of four there and back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After considering a few options, the &lt;strong&gt;Chase Ink Business Preferred® Card&lt;/strong&gt; was clearly the best fit. In addition to the 3X points on all Northwest Skill’s gas, tolls, and hotel expenses, Chase (at the time&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) was offering a sign-up bonus of 80,000 reward points for an annual fee of $95.
With the ability to &lt;a href=&quot;https://millionmilesecrets.com/guides/chase-ultimate-rewards-singapore-miles-united-flights/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;transfer Chase points to Singapore&lt;/a&gt;, that bonus alone got us halfway to our travel goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only potential deal-breaker: that generous welcome bonus required $5,000 worth of purchases in 3 months.  That initially seemed like a daunting amount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;planning-for-the-welcome-offer&quot;&gt;Planning for the Welcome Offer&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our biggest (and seemingly only) hurdle was ensuring we could hit the sign up bonus without putting Northwest Skills underwater.  We needed to understand exactly what was allowed to be charged on the business card. From the &lt;a href=&quot;https://applynow.chase.com/FlexAppWeb/pricing.do?card=G5FY&amp;amp;page_type=appterms&quot;&gt;Terms &amp;amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;By becoming a Visa Business Card cardmember, you agree that the card is being used only for business purposes and that the card is being issued to a public or private company including a sole proprietor or employees or contractors of an organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/deducting-business-expenses&quot;&gt;IRS’s definition of business expenses&lt;/a&gt;, we brainstormed all the expenses we have that are actually related to Northwest Skills.  In addition to the direct expenses mentioned above, we realized we have a significant number of other expenses that have a business purpose for Northwest Skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Utilities, internet and security due to Northwest Skills’ home office.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Car maintenance, insurance, and registration due to Northwest Skills’ use of our family car.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Laptop and other equipment used partially by Northwest Skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly we had plenty of expenses coming up over the next three months which had a business purpose. The key realization was that while some expenses are only partially deductible during tax season, those expenses are still for business purposes on the business card. We identified enough planned purchases and expenses with a business purpose to cover the minimum spend in time to receive the bonus offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;applying-for-credit&quot;&gt;Applying for Credit&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With confidence that we chose the right card and a plan to maximize the benefits while staying in our budget, it was up to Chase to decide whether Northwest Skills was worthy of credit.  While it seemed like applying for a business loan might be a big deal, we found enough &lt;a href=&quot;https://millionmilesecrets.com/guides/step-by-step-how-to-complete-a-chase-business-card-application/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;guides on other blogs&lt;/a&gt; to realize a credit card application was not the same grueling process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We collected all the required documents, unfroze our credit, and started the application. After double checking all the fields, we clicked &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Submit&lt;/code&gt;. The anticipation built up as we watched the swirling circles, and then came to a halt when the page said &lt;em&gt;the application was not approved&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily the guides prepared us for this moment. Kristin called the reconsideration line (800-453-9719). All they wanted to do was verify the information about the business, and then immediately gave her the good news “congratulations, your application has been approved”.  &lt;strong&gt;The takeaway here is to call the line, even though there was no indication on the application status that they just wanted to verify the information.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;did-it-work&quot;&gt;Did It Work?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We received the Ink Preferred a week after the phone call and started spending based on the plan.
While we did not have to spend anything that wasn’t planned, we did need to adjust some spending to fit within that three month window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three months later we received the welcome bonus.
We were not able to use the points exactly as planned due to reasons that deserve their own blog post, but we were able to book an award trip home from Hawaii with all the Ink points we earned during those three months (plus the $5.60/person security charge).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dollar value of those flights was around $1,400. Thus, for three months we were contributing over 25% of each purchase on the Ink card toward our flight home from Hawaii.
Despite not booking exactly as we initially intended, we still received a significant reward for purchases that we were already going to make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Covid arrived before we ever made it to Hawaii. All our points were returned when the flight was canceled, and Hawaii officially became a cursed destination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;

    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://creditcards.chase.com/a1/InkBusinessPreferred/8tk&quot;&gt;current offer&lt;/a&gt; for 100,000 bonus points after spending $15,000 in 3 months would not have been a good option for Northwest Skills. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Last year we decided to focus more on travel cards and maximizing rewards programs.
What prompted us to make the switch?
It was the culmination of many factors that led us to the realization that we could utilize rewards programs to better meet our goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#expensive-family-travel&quot;&gt;Family travel is expensive&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; Our travel budget took a major hit once we no longer had lap children.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#additional-restrictions-on-cash-back-cards&quot;&gt;Redeeming cash back is getting harder&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; Our credit cards (nearly simultaneously) made it more difficult to redeem cash back via restrictions and higher fees.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#devalued-frequent-flyer-miles&quot;&gt;Being a frequent flyer no longer means free flights&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; Despite flying more often for work trips, we were far away from being able to cash in on any of those accumulated miles.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#rewards-programs-and-the-social-security-of-travel&quot;&gt;Rewards programs increase markups&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; The high costs of competitive rewards programs are passed on to customers via (often hidden) markups on everyday prices.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#prioritizing-happiness-and-spontaneity&quot;&gt;Choosing between costs and happiness&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; On multiple occasions we chose to skip big events and alter family vacation plans due to the high costs of travel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;expensive-family-travel&quot;&gt;Expensive Family Travel&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once both our kids hit that magical &lt;a href=&quot;https://thepointsguy.com/guide/flying-with-lap-infant/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;age of 2&lt;/a&gt;, our flight costs doubled.
Upon seeing our total vacation expenses at the end of the year, my wife asked “did we even go anywhere?”.
Eight roundtrip flights during peak season to visit relatives pretty much exhausted our vacation budget for the year.
Rewards programs can help us offset those additional costs in a variety of ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;additional-restrictions-on-cash-back-cards&quot;&gt;Additional Restrictions on Cash Back Cards&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cash back credit cards used to earn all of our swipes, with a baseline of 2.5% back thanks to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alliantcreditunion.org/bank/visa-signature-card&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Alliant Signature Visa card&lt;/a&gt;.
Then Alliant increased the annual fee to $99 and (following the cash back trend) added a maximum earning per period as well as minimum redemption amount.
Using no annual fee 2% cash back cards (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.citi.com/credit-cards/credit-card-details/citi.action?ID=citi-double-cash-credit-card&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Citi Double Cash&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alliantcreditunion.org/bank/visa-platinum-rewards-card#features&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Alliant Visa Platinum Rewards&lt;/a&gt;) as a baseline, we now need to spend nearly $20,000 per year just to break even on the additional 0.5% cash back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other cards added additional restrictions how the cash back could be redeemed (typically only allowing statement credits, with Uber converting to a rewards program allowing only Uber cash redemptions).
Many rewards programs offer more flexibility in terms of redemption options that we could better utilize to meet our goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;devalued-frequent-flyer-miles&quot;&gt;Devalued Frequent Flyer Miles&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent a few years traveling across the country (and most recently – until Covid – the pond) a few times per year for work.
While being away from the kiddos due to work was never too enticing, we initially thought a silver lining would be the frequent flyer miles that came with it.
We had dreams of using those miles for fun addon trips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After four years of flying, United thanked me with a ceremonious label of “Premier Silver” status, but we were still far away from having enough miles to bring the family along.
This was a major deviation from my frequent flyer experience in college, when Southwest would just shove free flights in my face for virtually every “Wanna Get Away” fare I booked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We learned that the increased availability of miles via credit card rewards have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/travel/why-points-devaluations-arent-that-big-of-a-deal&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;significantly devalued miles earned from actual flying&lt;/a&gt;.
If we want to properly take advantage of these programs, we need to earn miles in the way that brings the most value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;rewards-programs-and-the-social-security-of-travel&quot;&gt;Rewards Programs and the Social Security of Travel&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As rewards programs continue to compete for customers, the cost of maintaining those programs is also rising.
While &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.valuepenguin.com/credit-card-surcharges-convenience-fees&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;explicit surcharges may be illegal and/or frowned upon&lt;/a&gt;, those costs are ultimately passed on to customers via (often indirect) markups on everyday prices as businesses strive to maintain margins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Markups are most evident with businesses that offer a separate cash and credit card price for the same items (the only difference being the processing fees), as well as the new Basic Economy fad that has hit the airlines (“basic” meaning you give up your right to a percentage of frequent flyer miles, among other freedoms).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the social security of travel; everyone is paying into the system with every purchase, but only those utilizing rewards programs are benefitting from it.
We decided to take back our portion of those markups by maximizing our rewards from these programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;prioritizing-happiness-and-spontaneity&quot;&gt;Prioritizing Happiness and Spontaneity&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both my wife and I have some of our fondest childhood memories from family vacations, and we hope to provide the same incredible experiences for our own children.
However, with our cash back rewards mostly restricted to statement credits, it is easy for us to lose focus on saving for the greater experiences.
On multiple occasions we chose to skip big events and alter vacation plans due to the high costs of travel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We intend to invest in rewards programs (especially those with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/transferable-credit-card-points-best-rewards-to-earn&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;transferrable points&lt;/a&gt;) to help us prioritize family vacations and take advantage of spontaneous events that are otherwise too expensive due to travel costs.
The next time Northwestern makes it to the Rose Bowl, our entire family will be there to see it live.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>PointHeads</name></author><summary type="html">For years we were content with paying cash for flights and hotels while enjoying cash back offered by a handful of credit cards.

After months of reading blogs, listening to podcasts, building spreadsheets and making plans, we decided to dive into the “points and miles” game and make 2020 the year of memorable vacations.  We followed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://thepointsguy.com/guide/beginners/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;getting started guides&lt;/a&gt;, started &lt;a href=&quot;https://awardwallet.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tracking&lt;/a&gt; our loyalty rewards programs, strategically &lt;a href=&quot;https://10xtravel.com/best-credit-cards/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;earned credit card bonuses&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/travel/how-to-earn-and-double-dip-with-online-shopping-portals&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“double dipped”&lt;/a&gt; for bonus points when we remembered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started our points-driven vacation year with a trip to Disney World for our son’s birthday. We followed that with our dream vacation to Hawaii, finally ending a decade-long procrastination.  After soaking up the sun in the Pacific we crossed the Atlantic, converting a wedding in Vienna into a two week trip exploring the Norwegian fjords and Austrian Alps.  We ended the year with a peaceful (and at times a bit wobbly) retreat to the vineyards in Napa Valley.  Thanks to our points providing travel and shelter for cheap, we were able to focus on having a great time during our vacations rather than stressing about staying under budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is how we expected to be looking back at 2020 before Covid came and blew everything up.  In reality, we had to cancel all our planned trips (there’s always next year, Hawaii…). However, even without Covid, we found ourselves struggling to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.travelcodex.com/earn-and-burn-why-hoarding-a-ton-of-airline-miles-is-not-always-a-good-idea/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“burn”&lt;/a&gt; our mountains of points the way we wanted.  While the how-to guides from the experts make it seem so simple, we discovered many nuances and stumbling blocks along the way that may seem obvious to the people who dedicate their lives to this hobby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This wild year has led us here, the pilot blog post for PointHeads. PointHeads is dedicated to making points and miles accessible to and advantageous for everyone. Our mission is to provide travel services that allow credit card users to travel frequently and affordably using rewards points earned from everyday spending. We will chronicle our journey from the last year and beyond as we transition from novice to expert – both in the tools we use and lessons we learn – so that you may follow along and take control of your rewards.&lt;/p&gt;
