        <p>Welcome to PointHeads. PointHeads is committed to protecting your privacy when you visit our Site. This page and all other pages comprising the website shall collectively be referred to as the “Site.”  PointHeads with its affiliates, successors, and assigns, are collectively referred to as “our”, “we”, “us”, or “PointHeads”. If you have questions concerning this Privacy Policy or other aspects of the Site, please email us at the address in the Contact Us section of this Site. We may change or add to this Privacy Policy from time-to-time at our sole and absolute discretion, so we encourage you to review it periodically.  You can access and browse our Site without disclosing any of your personal data. PointHeads does not collect personal information about individuals, such as names and mailing or e-mail addresses, unless it is knowingly provided by the individual and he or she has agreed to the terms under which PointHeads will use it.</p>

<h3 id="scope">SCOPE</h3>

<p>This Privacy Policy applies to the collection of personal information from visitors of this Site. It relates to information we collect from you, including Personally Identifying Information (also referred to as “PII”) and information that does not identify you personally. PII may include some or all of: your name, mailing address, email address, telephone number, mobile phone number, passwords, credit/debit card information, user name and password, and demographic information.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy applies to the use of the PointHeads website and email subscription services.  By using our Site you agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy, whether or not you subscribe to receive emails from PointHeads. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully.</p>

<h3 id="information-collected-and-used-by-pointheads">INFORMATION COLLECTED AND USED BY POINTHEADS</h3>

<p>When users register to receive emails from PointHeads (“Registered User”), PointHeads may collect personal information submitted by the Registered User such as name, mailing address, email address, and telephone number. PointHeads uses that information to authenticate Registered Users and to send notifications to those Registered Users relating to the PointHeads service or other matters PointHeads deems may interest the Registered User, including but not limited to special offers. PointHeads also uses the information to provide the products and services requested by the Registered User.</p>

<p>Besides PII, PointHeads may log and collect non-PII such as IP address, profile information, aggregate user data, and browser type from users of the Site. Data collected by PointHeads is used to improve the website services, to analyze trends, to administer the Site, to track users’ movements around the Site, and to gather macro demographic information about Site users. This non-PII may be shared with third-parties to provide more relevant services and advertisements to our users. If we share your email address with a third-party -  a party other than us, our immediate contractors, and email service provider - the email will be shared solely in hashed, non-human readable form. IP addresses of those who visit the Site may also be recorded for security and monitoring purposes.</p>

<p>In addition, PointHeads may use pixel tags - tiny graphic images - to tell us what parts of the Website have been visited or to measure the effectiveness of users’ searches performed on our Site. Pixel tags also enable us to send email messages in a format that our users can read. And they tell us whether emails have been opened. This assures we target our emails of interest to our users.</p>

<p>PointHeads may also use a Registered User’s email address to send information such as updates or news regarding PointHeads and the PointHeads service. Our email messages may use “click-through URL” or similar technology linked to content on the Site. When you click one of these URLs, they pass through our web server before arriving at the destination web page. PointHeads tracks this click-through data to help determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked simply avoid clicking text or graphic links in the email.
PointHeads may collect information for market research, about user activities on the Site and on related websites, and, if you are using a mobile device, information about the location of your device. PointHeads used information to develop, deliver, and improve our products, services, and other offerings.</p>

<p>Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, PointHeads will not disclose personal information to any third party unless it believes that disclosure is necessary: (1) to conform to legal requirements or to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other legal process received by PointHeads, whether or not a response is required by applicable law; (2) to enforce the PointHeads Terms and Conditions or to protect our rights; or (3) to protect the safety of members of the public and users of the service. PointHeads reserves the right to transfer personal information to a successor in interest that acquires rights to that information because of the sale of PointHeads or substantially all of its assets to that successor in interest.</p>

<p>PointHeads takes your privacy seriously. PointHeads does not sell or rent your contact information to other marketers. To help us provide superior service, your personal information may be shared internally within PointHeads. There are also times when PointHeads may make certain personal information about you available to companies that PointHeads has a strategic relationship with or that perform work for PointHeads to provide products and services to you on our behalf. These companies may help us process information, deliver products to you, manage and enhance customer data, provide customer service, assess your interest in our products and services, or conduct customer research or satisfaction surveys. These companies are also obligated to protect your personal information under PointHeads’s policies. Without such information being provided, it would be difficult for you to access certain services, offers, and content on the Site, receive customer service, or provide us feedback to improve our products and services.
This Site and our services are oriented toward a general audience and intended for adults only. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from those under the age of thirteen (13). If you believe that we have inadvertently collected personally identifiable information from a person under thirteen (13), please contact us so we can investigate and take any necessary remedial measures.</p>

<h3 id="use-of-cookies">USE OF COOKIES</h3>

<p>PointHeads may use cookies to store users’ preferences and to record session information. Cookies are for: (i) ensuring that visitors are not repeatedly offered the same advertisements; (ii) customizing newsletter, advertising, and Web page content based on browser type and user profile information; (iii) tracking usage to help us understand which parts of the Site are most popular, where our visitors are going, and how much time they spend there; (iv) analyzing the effectiveness of our customer communications, and (v) customizing user experiences; (vi) providing greater convenience to users, and (vii) other uses.</p>

<p>The cookies may reflect demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us, e.g., your email address. This data is stored in hashed, non-human readable form. You may configure your browser to accept or reject all or some cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. You can review the “Help” menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences. Most functions or our site require you to enable cookies.</p>

<p>PointHeads may allow third party advertisers to set and access their cookies on your computer via their pixel on our website and in email communications for which you have not opted out. These third parties may use cookies, pixel tags and other technologies to enable them to record which ads your browser has loaded and which pages you may have been viewing when the ads were delivered or accessed. The information collected through these functions is subject to the privacy policies of those third parties. If these sites use the Platform, the Platform’s privacy policy applies.</p>

<h3 id="do-not-track">DO-NOT-TRACK</h3>

<p>You may manage your settings in your web browsers to select “do not track.” We do not warrant or represent that our Site will respond to the “do not track” settings in your browser. You may go to other sites to opt out of interest-based adverting. Some of these may include TRUSTe’s Ad Choices, the Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out Page, the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Choice Page, or you can also visit Google’s Ad Settings to manage the ads Google serves. PointHeads makes not warranties or representations these or any other opt out sites will perform as described.</p>

<h3 id="links">LINKS</h3>

<p>PointHeads may contain links to third party websites. PointHeads is not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices on other sites. When linking to another site, a user should read the Privacy Policy stated on that site. Our Privacy Policy only governs information collected on this Site.</p>

<h3 id="international-users">INTERNATIONAL USERS</h3>

<p>PointHeads is a website operated from the United States by a company headquartered in the United States. If you are located outside of the United States, the information you provide to us will be transferred to the United States and governed by applicable U.S. laws and regulations and this Privacy Policy. By using the Site, you consent to this transfer and the processing of your data (personal or otherwise) under U.S. laws and regulations and this Privacy Policy. The laws in the United States regarding the processing of data (personal or otherwise) may be less stringent than the laws in your country.</p>
